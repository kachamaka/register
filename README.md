# ANGULAR 6 CUSTOM REGISTER TEMPLATE
Example template for register form
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To install open cmd or any kind of terminal you like and navigate to the path where you would like to install the register template.
Then simply type 'git clone https://github.com/kachamaka/register' and a new folder 'register' will appear. Inside the folder you have
register.module.ts. This module must be imported in app.module.ts. Then all you need to do is put the <register></register> tag in your
app.component.html file and you are all set!
